# Below are values that overclock the Raspberry Pi, pretty sure my warranty is gone.

# CPU/GPU core voltage adjustment. The value should be in the range [-16, 8] which equates to the range [0.8V, 1.4V]
# with 0.025V steps. In other words, specifying -16 will give 0.8V as the GPU/core voltage, and specifying 8 will give
# 1.4V. For defaults see table below. Values above 6 are only allowed when force_turbo is specified: this sets the
# warranty bit if over_voltage_* is also set.
over_voltage=8

# Frequency of the ARM CPU in MHz. Default 1500.
arm_freq=2147

# Sets core_freq, h264_freq, isp_freq, v3d_freq and hevc_freq together
gpu_freq=750
